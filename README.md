# Selection Sort
A simple implementation in Java of a sorting algorithm called the Selection Sort. This program accepts an input of an array of digits **121, 4, 34, 12, 11, 2, 1** and sorts it from the lowest to highest, resulting in an array of digits **1 2 4 11 12 34 121**.

It's time complexity is measured as O(n^2) similar to that of Bubble Sort. However with in-depth and comprehensive inspection it is apparent that it runs faster than the latter.
